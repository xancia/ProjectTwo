# PC Game Deals

This is my second project for Per Scholas, I wanted to create a website that utilized the cheapshark API for users to find pc game sales on big major and trusted sellers online such as Steam, GamersGate, and GreenManGaming.

# Demo

Please visit https://pcgamedeals.netlify.app/ to demo the app.

# Usage

Visit the deal search page and type the name of the game you want to search for, it must be a PC game. The card will display relevant information, you can click on the game info button to see more info about the game and read reviews if there are any, or you can click on the store button to go directly to the store and see the game there. The store button will be displayed as "Steam", "GamersGate", or "GreenManGaming" depending on the store.
